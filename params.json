I successfully completed my degree in marketing management, with a minor in finance.\r\n \r\nDuring the winter 2015 semester, I decided to participate in the International Exchange Program. This gave me the opportunity to study abroad in London, United Kingdom. The experience was phenomenal, as I was introduced to a variety of cultures during my travels throughout Europe. You can read more about my journey in my upcoming blog!\r\n",
