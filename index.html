      <p>I am a recent B. Comm Grad from the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University. I successfully completed my degree in marketing management, with a minor in finance.</p>

<p>During the winter 2015 semester, I decided to participate in the International Exchange Program. This gave me the opportunity to study abroad in London, United Kingdom. The experience was phenomenal, as I was introduced to a variety of cultures during my travels throughout Europe. You can read more about my journey in my upcoming blog!</p>
